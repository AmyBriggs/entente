# entente

This app - a collaboration between Ali Sue Hobbs, Anna Baldwin, and myself - is a Q3 project for the Full-Stack immersive program at Galvanize. 
Entente aims to connect users on important social and environmental issues via ESRI/ArcGIS maps and a chat feature with Socket.io.  Other 
technologies used were Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Angular.js, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap.
